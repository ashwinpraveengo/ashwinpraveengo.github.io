Setting Up the Development Environment\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSetting up a development environment is crucial. I made sure I had Hugo installed on my local machine and chose a code editor that I was comfortable with. I also configured version control using Git, ensuring that I could track changes and collaborate effectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"4-choosing-the-right-theme\"\u003e4. Choosing the Right Theme\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the advantages of Hugo is the plethora of themes available. After exploring various options, I settled on a theme that resonated with my style and purpose. Customizability was key for me, and the chosen theme allowed me to tweak and modify the design to fit my vision perfectly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"5-editing-theme-files\"\u003e5.

I modified config.yaml file.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"6-setting-up-github-repository-and-deploying-the-website\"\u003e6. Setting Up GitHub Repository and Deploying the Website\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCreating a GitHub repository for my website was the next logical step. I initialized a new repository on GitHub and cloned it to my local device. With my local repository in sync with GitHub, I proceeded to push the edited theme files and my content to the repository. Committied changes and pushed them to GitHub\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"7-hosting-my-website\"\u003e7. Hosting My Website\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe final and most exciting step was hosting my website.
